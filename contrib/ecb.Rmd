# ECB: Increase of the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme #

**In crisis times there is even more a need for high-quality data to be available on a
timely basis. The European Central Bank (ECB) and the national central banks (NCBs)
offer assistance to reporting agents to ensure that data remains fit for purpose.
The European Central Bank has introduced a Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme
(PEPP) to support the euro area banking sector, firms and households through the
COVID-19 crisis.**

Despite the current coronavirus pandemic, the ECB is
determined to continue collecting data on a timely basis and of
a quality that is fit for purpose. This will allow the ECB to have
the necessary statistical information at its disposal to adjust all
of its measures, should this be needed, to safeguard liquidity
conditions in the banking system and to ensure the smooth
transmission of its monetary policy.

This statistical information contributes to the maintenance of
price stability and the smooth conduct of policies pursued
by the competent authorities responsible for the supervision
and resolution of financial institutions, for markets and
infrastructures, and for the stability of the financial system.

Many reporting agents have adopted remote working
arrangements. Meanwhile, the continuity and quality of
statistical information reporting may be challenged by the
exceptional circumstances surrounding the performance of
day-to-day operations underlying the statistical reporting.
The ECB has therefore invited the national central banks
and reporting agents to find pragmatic solutions within the
existing legal framework to keep data reporting within limits
that are manageable for reporting agents, while maintaining
the quality of the statistical information at a sufficiently high
level.

In case of difficulties, reporting agents are asked to contact
their national central banks and the ECB for assistance. The
ECB and the national central banks cooperate closely with
other European institutions and bodies. Together with the
reporting agents, the ECB will rise to these unprecedented
challenges, thus ensuring that the data and statistics required
to support the necessary policy measures are fit for purpose.
