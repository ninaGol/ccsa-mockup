# Project Background #

This is an experimental project to explore the potential for producing
an RStudio-based supplement to (or possibly an entire replacement version of)
the [How COVID-19 Is Changing the World][covid2] series of reports from the CCSA.

Currently, the `prototype` branch contains code to build an online, interactive report
based on member contributions. The plan is for each member to contribute a chapter
in RMarkdown format (including R code) along with data files in open formats. Chapters
are organized in the `contrib/` directory while data files are organized in the `data/`
directory; each file name should begin with an organizational prefix such as `wbg-`.
